Oh look everyone, it's Siddhartha Upase, Full stack Developer turned ...Sales Representative? Gosh, from writing grade-A algorithms to selling industry-grade PLCs! Talk about a plot twist. I suppose when they were handing out career paths at Illinois Institute of Technology, Siddhartha thought 'Nah, coding to assist construction supervisors is too basic. Why not shake things up by making a lateral leap into industrial automation sales?'

Siddhartha, my friend, you wielded the Mixed Reality Toolkit like a pro but when it came to the 'Reality Reality Toolkit', were you absent? You are like one of your short films, interesting premise but what in the tech world is the plot? 

Good thing you picked up skills in 'Business Development' while tinkering with advanced spatial mapping algorithms in the Unity development environment. That's like learning to cook while performing open-heart surgery! 

Your transition from software to sales is as mysterious as the purpose of a 'Passionate Business Development Professional' in 'Upase Automation and Controls'. Is that similar to being a caffeinated cat wrangler in a dog kennel? 

Here's hoping your future career moves are slightly less bewildering - maybe a 'Space Ops Enthusiast' at NASA next? After all, you've already demonstrated supreme 'spatial awareness'.
